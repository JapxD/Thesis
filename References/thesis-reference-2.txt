Problem and its' Statement
- the frist and foremost steps happens to be that selecting and properly definiing a research
Research Problem
- refer some difficulty which a researcher experience in trhe context of either a theoretical or practical situation and wants to obtain a solutin for the same.
- There must be at least two course of action to be pursued.
- obtaining the objectives(statement of the problem)

component of a research
- has difficulty to the problem
- has some objective
- must remain doubt in the mind of a researcher
- controversial subject should not be come the choice of an average reseacher
- not too narrow or too broad

selecting the problem
- the subject selected for research should be familair and feasible so that the related researsch material or sources of research of reseasrh are within one's reach
- selection of a problem must be preceded by a preliminary study(may basehan, bawal bias dito)

Technique involved in defining a prboelm
- statemetn fo the problem in a general way
- understatnding the natire of the problem
- surveying the avaible literature
- developing the throufh discussions
- rephrasing the research problem

background of the study
- proponent should describe the existing and prevailing problem situation based on his/her experience. The scope may be global, national, regional, and local
- the proponent should give strong justification for selecting such reseasrch prpoblem in  his/her capacity as a researcher. Being a part of the organization or systems and the desire and concern to imporve the systems

Hypothesis
- is not a question. but rather it is a statement about the relation between two or more variables
alternative hyp
- goal is to accept or to reject the hypothesis
- walang kinikilingan sa mga researches na katulad
Experimental
- kapag in-apply ko dito yung solution, ano dapat mangyayari.
- may comparison between sa dating research sa solution(approach) na ginagawa
- mas maganda na kayang imatch sa leading brand
- 

SPSS
- tool for statistic

Significant of the study
- describe the contribution
- bakit importante yung study
- paano nakatulong yung study sa iba
-

RRL
- may topic tas discuss lang
- 

Conceptual Framework
- dapat may kaugnay sa statement of the problem
- bawal i-base sa previous work or copyahin mismo
- conte
- no process
- layman's term, non-tech view
- relationship of one variable to other variables
- backbone of the research
- proof of concept
- mga variables na nagaaffect sa concept
- schematic diagram which show the variables

two methods of conceptual framework
- IPO (Input -> Process -> Output)
 - kung paano mo ipinakita
 - input variable, kapag pinrocess ano yung output
- IV DV (Independent Variable -> Dependent Variable)
- walang output

sample
research paradigm
WRAP
Input 		-> process (treatment)
url 		-> structure
structure 	-> url validity
valid url 	-> keywords                               |-> WRAP
          	|
          	+-> images/embedded data
keywords 	-> bad words, NG words, not friendly word
images/embedded data -> bad image 

Paradigm shift
- kapag hindi feasible ang koncepto, magkakaroon ng shift
